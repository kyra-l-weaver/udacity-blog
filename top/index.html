    Beautiful rolling hills with views that go on as far as the eye can see
    <br />
    Nature, undisturbed, pristine, no humans or man-made dwellings for miles and miles
    <br /> 
    A plethora of wildlife, flora and fauna native to New York
    <br />
    A playground with lakes to swim in, streams to collect water, hills to bike on... <em> All available by public transportation, an hour from New York City.</em>
    <br /> <strong>Best of all, it's free!</strong> 
    <br /> Welcome to Harriman State Park, a hiking nature preserve almost as old as the country itself. Dotted with lean-tos, the park was a way for the New Yorkers of old to strap on their boots and explore nature via rail line. It's the most romantic getaway I can personally think of. So let me show you around! (You're welcome!)
