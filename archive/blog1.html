  <h1>Day Trip with the Harriman Trail Challengers</h1>
  Isn't it fun to meet with like-minded individuals? I joined a facebook group called the Harriman Trail Challengers. Their fearless leader organizes trips in the park, even throughout the winter!
  I've always wanted to go, but as they always plan trips that start in parking lots far from train stations, I was having trouble joining them.
  One day, I decided to try anyway. Lo and behold, someone volunteered to pick me up from the suffern train station and drive to the starting point. So kind!
  I am not used to hiking with a group, so I was a little disappointed to find out I was kind of slow. Uh... and one of the younger ones in the group, so I didn't even have my advanced age of 41 as an excuse!
