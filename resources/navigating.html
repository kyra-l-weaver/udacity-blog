    Learn how to read blazes! There are more than 20 trails in Harriman State Park. When you start hiking on a less-traveled path, it becomes necessary to always keep the blazes in sight. Think of yourself as swinging on monkey bars when you were a kid, as soon as you release one bar, you are swinging purposefully to the next. The blazes are your bars, always know where the next one is.
   You need both a GPS map loaded on your phone and a physical map
   -download Avenza + Harriman / Bear Mountain map set. It costs about $8.99 but the cost goes to the New York / New Jersey Trail conference, who maintain the trails. Think of it as your one time entry fee.
   The GPS is extremely useful, as it doesn't require cell service, and you can quickly find your way back to the trail if you lost the blazes.
  The backup map and compass are great on the high chance that your phone dies.
