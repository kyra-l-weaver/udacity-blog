   Free fun vacation destination! In nature! Need I say more??
   There's one catch: Camping in Harriman is 100% primitive. What does that mean?
   Nothing, not even water, not even toilets, nothing! is provided.
   There are 9 lean-to's around the park, and staying in them overnight is on a first-come, first-serve basis.
   You may also pitch a tent within 150' of any of these shelters.
   Anywhere else is technically illegal, so don't risk it.
   Here is the list of shelters:
   <ul>
    <li>Dutch Doctor</li><li>Tom Jones</li><li>Bald Rocks</li><li>Big Hill</li><li>Fingerboard</li>
   </ul>
   <b>Note:</b> there are bears in the park. I have seen one personally. It was small and walked away as soon as it saw me, but I would not trust it to stay out of my tent if there were food in it. Make sure to bring a bear bag and know how to hang it. There are cables with pre-tied carabiners for you to mount your bags by most shelters.
