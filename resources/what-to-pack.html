    You will need a bunch of stuff if you want to overnight in Harriman, but there is good news: there are free, no-reservations required shelters around the park.
    That being said, some leak, some have mice, some have ticks, and some have other stinky hikers in them. So I'd recommend bringing a tent.
    Here's what <u>I</u> packed:
    Think of it as bringing different rooms
    <ul><li>
      <b>Bedroom:</b> tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad (yes you need this), lantern, camp pillow (optional)
    </li><li>
      <b>Kitchen:</b> portable cook stove, fuel, instant meals, spork, water bottle, water filter, collapsible bowl, bear bag with paracord and carabiner
    </li><li>
     <b>Bathroom:</b> first aid kit, trowel, tp, baby wipes (in place of a shower)
    </li><li>
      <b>'Vehicle':</b> backpack, hiking shoes, wool socks, poles, headlamp, snacks, 2l water bladder with hose
    </li>
  </ul>
  All of this stuff, when chosen wisely, can fit in a 40 liter pack that weighs about 16lb and is good for up to 3 nights.
