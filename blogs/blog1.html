      <h3>Isn't it fun to meet with like-minded individuals?</h3>
      <p>
        I joined a facebook group called the Harriman Trail Challengers. Their
        fearless leader organizes trips in the park, even throughout the
        winter! I've always wanted to go, but as they always plan trips that
        start in parking lots far from train stations, I was having trouble
        joining them.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, I decided to try anyway. Lo and behold, someone volunteered
        to pick me up from the suffern train station and drive to the starting
        point. So kind!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not used to hiking with a group, so I was a little disappointed
        to find out I was kind of slow. Uh... and one of the younger ones in
        the group, so I didn't even have my advanced age of 41 as an excuse!
      </p>
      <p>Before going with a group, you should know what to bring on a day trip:
      <ul>
        <li>Backpack with water and snaxx</li>
        <li>IN CASE OF EMERGENCY because emergencies happen:</li>
        <li>headlamp</li>
        <li>first aid kit</li>
        <li>phone charger</li>
        <li>mylar emergency blanket</li>
      </ul>

      </p>

      </p>
      <p> You should also know how to read blazes. There are more than 20 trails in Harriman State Park. When you
        start hiking on a less-traveled path, it becomes necessary to always keep the blazes in sight. Think of
        yourself as swinging on monkey bars when you were a kid, as soon as you release one bar, you are swinging
        purposefully to the next. The blazes are your bars, always know where the next one is.
        You need both a GPS map loaded on your phone and a physical map
        -download Avenza + Harriman / Bear Mountain map set. It costs about $8.99 but the cost goes to the New York /
        New Jersey Trail conference, who maintain the trails. Think of it as your one time entry fee.
        The GPS is extremely useful, as it doesn't require cell service, and you can quickly find your way back to the
        trail if you lost the blazes.
        The backup map and compass are great on the high chance that your phone dies.
