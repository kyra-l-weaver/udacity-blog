      <h3>Solo Overnight</h3>
      <p>
        Hey, I know it isn't exactly summer anymore, but I got my gear and
        it's burning a hole in my closet! I gotta go!
      </p>
      <p>This through trek started at the Southfields Coach USA stop.</p>
      <p>
        I hiked up the Nurian trail, with a rickety scary wooden bridge over
        the Ramapo river, and a solid scary pedestrian overpass over I-87.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today my destination was Bald Rocks, a shelter 6 miles uphill. With
        exactly 6 hours of daylight left, I figured I would meet my pace of a
        mile an hour and get set for camp just as the sun was setting.
      </p>
      <p> Camping in Harriman is 100% primitive. What does that mean?
        Nothing, not even water, not even toilets, nothing! is provided.<br />
        There are 9 lean-to's around the park, and staying in them overnight is on a first-come, first-serve
        basis.<br />
        You may also pitch a tent within 150' of any of these shelters.<br />
        Anywhere else is technically illegal, so don't risk it.<br />
        Here is the list of shelters:
      <ul>
        <li>Dutch Doctor</li>
        <li>Tom Jones</li>
        <li>Bald Rocks</li>
        <li>Big Hill</li>
        <li>Fingerboard</li>
      </ul>
      <b>Note:</b> there are bears in the park. I have seen one personally. It was small and walked away as soon as it
      saw me, but I would not trust it to stay out of my tent if there were food in it. Make sure to bring a bear bag
      and know how to hang it. There are cables with pre-tied carabiners for you to mount your bags by most shelters.
      </p>
      <p>You will need a bunch of stuff if you want to overnight in Harriman, but there is good news: there are free,
        no-reservations required shelters around the park.
        That being said, some leak, some have mice, some have ticks, and some have other stinky hikers in them. So I'd
        recommend bringing a tent.
        Here's what <u>I</u> packed:
        Think of it as bringing different rooms.

      </p>
      <p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Bedroom:</b> tent, sleeping bag, sleeping pad (yes you need this), lantern, camp pillow (optional)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Kitchen:</b> portable cook stove, fuel, instant meals, spork, water bottle, water filter, collapsible bowl,
          bear bag with paracord and carabiner
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bathroom:</b> first aid kit, trowel, tp, baby wipes (in place of a shower)
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>'Vehicle':</b> backpack, hiking shoes, wool socks, poles, headlamp, snacks, 2l water bladder with hose
        </li>
      </ul>
      All of this stuff, when chosen wisely, can fit in a 40 liter pack that weighs about 16lb and is good for up to 3
      nights.
