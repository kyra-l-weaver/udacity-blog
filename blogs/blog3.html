        Camping overnight in Harriman State Park is a great way to disconnect from the hustle and bustle of daily life
        and reconnect with nature. This beautiful park located in New York state offers over 200 miles of hiking trails
        and 31 lakes and reservoirs, making it an excellent destination for outdoor enthusiasts.

        Before embarking on your camping trip, it's important to plan ahead and ensure that you have all the necessary
        gear. For our trip, we brought a tent, sleeping bags, a camping stove, and plenty of food and water. We also
        packed warm clothing as the temperatures at night can get quite chilly, even during the summer months.
      </p>
      <p>
        We decided to hike the Pine Meadow Trail, which is a 6.7-mile loop that takes you through some of the park's
        most scenic areas. The trail starts at the Pine Meadow Lake parking lot and takes you around the lake, over
        streams, and through dense forest. We were rewarded with stunning views of the lake and the surrounding
        mountains.

        After hiking for a few hours, we arrived at our campsite, which was located near Pine Meadow Lake. We set up our
        tent and cooked a hot meal on our camping stove. As the sun began to set, we gathered around the campfire and
        enjoyed the quiet sounds of nature.
      </p>
      <p>

        Unfortunately, something went wrong during the night. We had forgotten to properly store our food, and a group
        of raccoons managed to get into our cooler and eat all of our snacks. We learned our lesson and made sure to
        properly store our food for the remainder of the trip.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next day, we continued our hike on the Pine Meadow Trail and were treated to even more breathtaking views.
        We saw a variety of wildlife, including deer and a black bear in the distance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, our camping trip to Harriman State Park was a wonderful experience. We were able to disconnect from
        technology and spend quality time with each other and nature. If you're looking for a great camping destination,
        Harriman State Park is definitely worth considering. Just remember to properly store your food to avoid any
        unwanted visitors!
