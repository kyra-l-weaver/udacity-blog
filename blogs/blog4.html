      <h3>Bringing the Kids</h3>
      <p>
        Mia is 6 and just recently decided she wanted to do an overnight, so we packed her pack very light (she was in
        charge of snacks and marshmallows). Ray is 9 so he got a 30 liter backpack with a water bladder and a sleeping
        bag, lights, water filter. Adults were in charge of other sleeping bags, the tent, pads, cooking stove and
        dehydrated food. It was a regular coleman 6 person tent so very heavy! Our light backpacking tent only sleeps 2
        and we didn’t want to buy a bunch more stuff just for the trip.
      </p>
      <p>I am happy to report this was 100% legit primitive camping, nothing for you but a patch of dirt where you could
        pitch a tent!</p>
      <p>In order to plan, I took an overnight backpacking course with REI, and learned some things I wouldn’t have
        thought of. Then I tried that same route (Tuxedo station to Dutch Doctor shelter, about a 3 mile hike) without
        the kids , and realized it would be fine to bring them. Then I made a packing list and did a practice run of
        what would go in who’s packs, thinking about a weight limit of 10-20% body weight. We also brought lots of
        snacks and easy food like cup noodles, not to mention smores kits and uno for the kids! Basically... if you can
        keep the kids happy and
        comfortable it will be a success!</p>
      <summary>Bringing the kids can make lasting memories for the whole family! Positive memories, even, if you plan
        right!</summary>
